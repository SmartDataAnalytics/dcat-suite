Concepts: Data Project, Dataset, Distribution, Resource

Data resource is an entity that can act as a distribution.

Uploading a file allocates a fresh data resource. The data resource is represented by some (globally?) unique IRI.
The location of the file in the file system is an attribute of the data resource.
